## 💡JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
```
Developers use HTML and CSS to control the content and styling of a page. And they use JavaScript to make that page interactive.

In this JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Certification, you'll learn the JavaScript fundamentals like variables, arrays, objects, loops, functions, the DOM and more.

You'll also learn about Object Oriented Programming (OOP), Functional Programming, algorithmic thinking, how to work with local storage, and how to fetch data using an API.

>In this project, you'll code a basic MP3 player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project covers fundamental concepts such as handling audio playback, managing a playlist, implementing play, pause, next, previous, and shuffle functionalities. You'll even learn how to dynamically update your user interface based on the current song.

### 🗓️ [Date formatter](04-date-formatter)

>Working with dates in JavaScript can be challenging. You have to navigate various methods, formats, and time zones. In this project, you'll learn how to work with the JavaScript Date object, including its methods and properties. You'll also learn how to correctly format dates.

>This project will cover concepts such as the ```getDate()```, ```getMonth()```, and ```getFullYear()``` methods.

### 🔤 [Palindrome Checker](05-palindrome-checker)
>This is one of the required projects to earn your certification.
>For this project, you'll build an application that checks whether a given word is a palindrome.

### ⚽ [Football team cards](06-football-team-cards)

>One common aspect of building web applications: processing datasets, and then outputting information to the screen. In this sports team cards project, you'll learn how to work with DOM manipulation, object destructuring, event handling, and data filtering.

>This project will cover concepts like switch statements, default parameters, ```Object.freeze()```, the ```map()``` method, and more.

### ✅ [Todo app](07-todo-app)

>Local storage is a web browser feature that lets web applications store key-value pairs persistently within a user's browser. This allows web apps to save data during one session, then retrieve it in a later page session.

>In this TODO application, you'll learn how to handle form inputs, manage local storage, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks, implement event listeners, and toggle UI elements.

### 🔂 [Decimal to binary converter](08-decimal-to-binary-converter)

>Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself. This can reduce a complex problem into simpler sub-problems, until they become straightforward to solve.

>In this project, you’ll build a decimal-to-binary converter using JavaScript. You’ll learn the fundamental concepts of recursion, explore the call stack, and build out a visual representation of the recursion process through an animation.

### [Roman numeral converter](09-roman-numeral-converter)
>This is one of the required projects to earn your certification.

>For this project, you'll build an application that converts integers to Roman numerals.

### [Number sorter](10-number-sorter)

>In computer science, there are fundamental sorting algorithms that all developers should learn. In this number sorter project, you'll learn how to implement and visualize different sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort – all with JavaScript.

>This project will help you understand the fundamental concepts behind these algorithms, and how you can apply them to sort numerical data in web applications.

### [Statistics calculator](11-statistics-calculator)

>As you expand your JavaScript skills, you'll want to get comfortable with array manipulation methods, such as ```map()```, ```reduce()```, and ```filter()```.

>In this statistics calculator project, you'll gain experience with handling user input, DOM manipulation, and method chaining. You'll get practice by performing statistical calculations like mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.

### [Spreadsheet](12-spreadsheet)

>Functional Programming is a popular approach to software development. In Functional Programming, developers organize code into smaller functions, then combine those functions to build complex programs.

>In this spreadsheet application project, you'll learn about parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions, implementing spreadsheet functions, handling cell references, and creating interactive web interfaces. You'll learn how to dynamically update the page based on user input.

>This project will cover concepts like the ```map()``` method, ```find()``` method, ```parseInt()```, the ```includes()``` method.

### [Span filter](13-span-filter)

>Regular expressions, often shortened to "regex" or "regexp", are patterns that help programmers match, search, and replace text. Regular expressions are powerful, but can be difficult to understand because they use so many special characters.

>In this spam filter project, you'll learn about capture groups, positive lookaheads, negative lookaheads, and other techniques to match any text you want.
