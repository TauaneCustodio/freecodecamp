## üé®Responsive web design
```
In this Responsive Web Design Certification, you'll learn the languages that developers use to build webpages:
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

First, you'll build a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Later, you'll learn modern techniques
like CSS variables by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a quiz site.

Finally, you'll learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a photo gallery
with Flexbox, and a magazine article layout with CSS Grid.
